"If the boolean variable flag is true, then execute the code inside the if block."

🔍 Explanation:
flag is a variable of type boolean, which can hold only two values: true or false.

In an if statement, Java expects a condition that evaluates to true or false.

So when you write if (flag), it checks whether flag == true.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
boolean flag = true;

if (flag) {
    System.out.println("Flag is true!");
}

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Alternative (longer) syntax:
if (flag == true)
This works the same as if (flag), but if (flag) is preferred for readability.
